        The <u><b>Simpson family</b></u> consists of fictional characters featured in the animated television series The
        Simpsons. <br>The Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three
        children Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. <br>They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield,
        United
        States, and they were created by cartoonist Matt Groening,<br> who conceived the characters after his own family
        members, substituting "Bart" for his own name. <br>The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey
        Ullman
        Show short "Good Night" and were later spun off into their own series,<br> which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on
        December 17, 1989.

        pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. <br>Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to
        have
        great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. <br>He also
        serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.

        <u><b>Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson</b></u> (born April 1) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, <br>
        disruptive
        and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. <br> He is the only son of Homer
        and
        Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. <br> He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after
        discovering a
        comet in "Bart's Comet". <br> Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
        "Simpsons
        Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". <br> Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson
        Comics
        Presents Bart Simpson. <br> Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

        <u><b>Lisa Marie Simpson </b></u> (born May 9) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and
        one of
        the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) <br> of The Simpsons series.

        In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. <br> She was named after a train
        called
        Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. <br> She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard
        achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. <br> Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the
        moral
        center of her family. <br> In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to
        hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, <br> and interest in advanced
        studies. In
        school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only
        a few friends. <br> She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is
        already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. <br> Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out
        to
        those who she deems lower than her or even above her. <br> She has extreme jealously from time to time and will
        do
        whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. <br> Otherwise,
        she's the
        intelligent one who usually thinks things through.
